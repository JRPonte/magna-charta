## Release History / Changelist

_We use [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) for our version numbers._

__1.2.2__
- added option to add padding to cells with small values, to make sure it's always wide enough for the value to be visible

__1.2.1__
- fixed bug that meant it would break with tables that didn't have a `caption` tag

__1.2.0__
- "toggle" link is now automatically added to both the table and the graph. Has class of `mc-toggle-link`.
- new option, `toggleText`, defining what text the toggle link should contain.
- new method, `magnaCharta#toggle`, that shows/hides the graph and toggles the class `visually-hidden` on the table, which is styled to hide the table in a more accessible way.

__1.1.3__
- fixed bug that meant screen-reader users did not have access to the tables and instead had to try to understand the div chart

__1.1.2__
- fixed bug that broke negative bar charts when using outdented text, extra margins are now applied to deal with this. Some CSS styling also required ( see the sample stylesheet within `demo`).
- removed functionality that removes negative sign from negative values within chart. Decided it was misleading and not entirely clear (hat-tip @rooreynolds).

__1.1.1__
- change to make the outdented text option to be set through a class on the table, by adding `mc-outdented`, as an alternative to setting it as an option through the JS. Both work, adding a class is preferred.


__1.1.0__
- added options to allow the text to be outdented, so it sits outside the bar, just to the right.
- To do this, set `outdentText` option to `true`. The default amount to allow is the bar width + 3%, but you can set the value `outdentTextLevel` to something new.

__1.0.0__
- we completely rewrote Magna Charta, and are "re-releasing" as V1.0.0. From now on we'll use proper semantic versioning to manage releases.
- instead of applying CSS and styling to a table, we duplicate the table as a large amount of `div`s, that are styled. Doing this instead of styling a table means we end up not fighting browser's interpretations of table styling.
